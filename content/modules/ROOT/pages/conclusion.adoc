We hope you’ve enjoyed your hands-on experience with *OpenShift Virtualization on ROSA* and gained valuable insights into how this powerful combination can support your journey to modernize and manage workloads in the cloud.

By leveraging *Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)*, you benefit from a fully managed OpenShift environment deeply integrated with AWS services—making it easier than ever to run both containerized and virtual machine workloads in a scalable, secure, and cloud-native way.

[[key_takeaways]]
== Key Takeaways

* OpenShift Virtualization is a solution-oriented platform designed to help you import, run, and manage legacy virtual machines—while also serving as a bridge toward cloud-native application modernization.

* When deployed on ROSA, OpenShift Virtualization combines the best of both worlds: cloud-native innovation and the flexibility to run traditional VMs—without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.

* This technology lays a solid foundation for running traditional workloads securely and reliably, while also equipping you with the tools and skills needed for building modern applications on a unified platform.

=== Red Hat Learning Services: DO317 Managing Virtual Machines with Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

* Skills required to create, access, and manage VMs on OpenShift clusters.
* Skills required to control usage and access of cpu, memory, storage, and networking resources from VMs using the same Kubernetes features that would also control usage and access to these resources for containers.
* Sample architectures to manage High Availability (HA) of VMs using standard Kubernetes features and extensions from OpenShift Virtualization.
* Strategies to connect VMs on OpenShift to data center services outside of their OpenShift cluster, such as storage and databases.
* Strategies to migrate VMs from compatible hypervisors to OpenShift Virtualization by using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization operator.

=== Virtualization Migration Assessment

* A two-week onsite interactive workshop and follow-up report. 
* Experienced Red Hat architects run a short series of onsite workshops to help develop your migration journey.
* They provide an extensive review of your virtualization environment and it's current integrations including: networking, storage, security, backup, and disaster recovery.
* You recieve a VMA report with a tailored proposal for your complete migration incluing high-level recommendations and design considerations.
* This can help with understanding of where you're going, how you'll get there, how long it will take, and how much it will cost.
